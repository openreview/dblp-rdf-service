# Tasks
## Diff 2 dblp rdf dumps
    - Use grep/count/uniq to find new entries
    - Use jena/sparql
      - load 2 named graphs, then use select/filter
    - Use `rdfdiff` command, but it runs out of memory

## Verify that Bibtex output is complete and valid via test cases
    - maybe integrate into running system to validate on the fly, report err/warnings
